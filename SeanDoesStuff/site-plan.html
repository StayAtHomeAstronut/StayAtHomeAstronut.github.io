        Who am I?
      </p>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Seán! I designed this website to share my passion for travel, adventure, and the outdoors with the world. Growing up in Utah, I spent many a summer exploring towering mountains, red rocks, and jagged canyons with my family. From a young age, nature became an important part of my life and a way for me to bond with the people closest to me. The purpose of SeanDoesStuff is to connect people who share my passion with the recourses to experience those places for themselves. On my website, you'll find photography of places that are special to me, along with blogs and content describing how I went about visiting those places, so that you can experience those places for yourself. The outdoors hold a special place in my heart. My hope is that this website, along with my social media handles, will become a tool to bring people together, and to help them create great memories in the outdoors.
      </p>

      <p>
        In exchange for the information on this website, I ask that you treat these places with respect. On rare occasions, I may withhold information about a particular location to prevent it from being disrespected or desecrated by visitors. Irresponsible exploration is very detrimental to the delicate state of our unique ecosystem. By exploring responsibly and remembering to leave no trace, we can combat the damage done by inconsiderate visitors.

      <h3>[Places]</h3>
      <p>
        I am constantly striving to find new adventures! If you're like me, you're probably looking for amazing places to see and experience. I categorize all of my photos and videos by where I took them, so that you can more easily find and experience those places for yourself. Some of the places I visit are easier to access than others. My adventures range from simple parking-lot views to strenuous back-country adventures. Whatever your cup of tea is, I designed this website for you. Here, you can find detailed descriptions of my trips, their cost, the supplies required, and how to obtain the correct permits, if necessary. I know well when it comes to planning a trip, advice from someone who has seen or experienced those locations can be valuable. My goal is to make these amazing places more accessible to those who want to experience them.

      <h3>[Plan an adventure]</h3>
      <p>
        Over the course of my adventures, I've come to learn that planning an adventure for yourself doesn't always have to be as daunting as it seems. With careful consideration, you can have a great trip with little cost, plenty of adventure, and minimal surprises. A common myth about travelling is that it needs to be expensive, or that premade plans are necessarily better. The reality is, you can plan an exciting adventure for yourself, see the things you want to see, and do it all for relatively cheap - if you know what you’re doing. The purpose of SeanDoesStuff is to connect you to the resources you need to plan an adventure, without the hassle of going through a tour company or working with a travel agent. This leaves you free to see what you want to see and to make valuable memories.
